-  * 66a136e6d8 Fixing issues raised in `#41540`_ when a zip file is created on a Windows system.  The issue has two parts, first directories that end up in the archive end up in the results of aarchive.list twice as they show up as both files and directories because of the logic to handle the fact that Windows doesn't mark them as directories.  This issue shows up when an extraction is run a second time since the module verified the file types and the subdirectory is not a file.  The second issue is related to permissions, if Salt is told to extract permissions (which is the default) then the directory and files end up being unreadable since the permissions are not available.  This change sets the permissions to what the default umask for the user running Salt is.
