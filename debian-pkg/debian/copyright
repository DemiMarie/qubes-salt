License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
 OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
 RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
 AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
   1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
      for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
      ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
      this License.
   2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms
      or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
      listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection
      and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual
      creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in
      unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
      together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
      constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
      defined above) for the purposes of this License.
   3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
      and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale
      or other transfer of ownership.
   4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
      work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
      the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
      publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
      actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
      sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
      literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
      case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
      who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
      (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
      the broadcast.
   6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any production
      in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
      the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as
      a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
      other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
      work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a
      musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work
      to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
      cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
      sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
      are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
      photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
      sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography,
      topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
      phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as
      a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
      performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
      or artistic work.
   7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
      with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
      from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
      previous violation.
   8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
      and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
      means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
      digital performances; to make available to the public Works in
      such a way that members of the public may access these Works from
      a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the
      Work to the public by any means or process and the communication
      to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public
      digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
      means including signs, sounds or images.
   9. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
      including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the
      right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including
      storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
      other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising
    from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection
    with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
    applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;
   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
      that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
      translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
      English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
      original work has been modified.";
   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,
   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   5.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt:
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot
            be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
            collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
            granted under this License;
         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
            in which the right to collect royalties through any
            statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
            Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
            royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
            under this License; and,
         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
            that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
            administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
            from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
            License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
      Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
      Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
      impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
      License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
      the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
      License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
      not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
      restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
      the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated
      in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
      from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
      License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor
      You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection
      any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You
      create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
      the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(b), as requested.
   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
      or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
      to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
      and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing:
      (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable)
      if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
      designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
      publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
      Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
      other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)
      the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
      associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
      copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
      consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
      credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
      "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
      "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The
      credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any
      reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
      Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear,
      if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or
      Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
      at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
      authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
      required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
      manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
      License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
      connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
      You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
      written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
      Attribution Parties.
   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
      otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
      or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.
      Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b)
      of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to
      be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
      action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation,
      the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this
      Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
      national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
      under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but
      not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
    FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
    LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
      Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
      Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
      their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
      remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5,
      6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
      the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
      to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
      distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
      election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
      license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
      terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
      force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
      You under this License.
   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
      the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
      this License.
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
      of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
      action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
      reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
      valid and enforceable.
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
      breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
      consent.
   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
      with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
      Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.
   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
      applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
      under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
      granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
      be included in the License; this License is not intended to
      restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
